Risk Score Analysis and Granular Navigation
When a user clicks the Risk Score arrow button, the application opens the Risk Overview page. This page allows users to switch between Supplier, Performance, and Compliance risk types based on previously selected hierarchy filters. Users can view the Risk vs Trend chart, which is displayed as a line chart with segmented background colors:
• 0 to 33: Low Risk (Green Background)
• 33.1 to 68: Medium Risk (Orange Background)
• 67.1 to 100: High Risk (Red Background)
Above the line chart, two metrics are shown: Current Score (the latest month's risk score) and Score Change (difference between the latest month and the previous month).
Risk Summary Section
The Risk Summary page provides Current Risk Score and Score Change definitions. Users can also view Risk vs Trend explanations. A toggle button allows switching between Risk Summary and Risk Summary Supplier views.
In Risk Summary, the system displays the following analytical components:
• KPI Driver Analysis
• Correlation Analysis
• Association Analysis
• Supplier Deferred Distribution Analysis (available only for Supplier risk type)
Users can switch between risk types and risk categories (High, Medium, Low). All visualizations in this section are displayed using bar charts.
Association and Correlation Analysis
The Association Analysis includes two dropdowns: Deferred Type and KPI Selection. Using the Deferred Type dropdown, users can switch the X-axis between Deferred Group Name and Deferred Type Description. The selected KPI influences the correlation chart, allowing users to view relationships between KPI values and risk outcomes.
